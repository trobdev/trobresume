# TRob Resume Project

## Description
This is a cloud-based resume.  It builds on some of the work I did before, making a static website with Terraform. This is inspired by the Cloud Resume Challenge by Forrest Brazeal, with slight modification.  I decided to make this to get familiar with what it takes to build a full-stack application.

## Features
This involves:

* A front-end using HTML/CSS/JS
* A back-end using AWS API Gateway, Lambda, Python Boto3, and DynamoDB
* Source control with Git + GitHub
* A CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
* Testing (still deciding how to do this as of 12FEB22)

## Design Decisions
I've decided to use Terraform instead of CloudFormation because of its overall flexibility and potency as a multi-cloud IaC tool.

## Function
This website hosts my resume and is intended to be used for viewing only.

## Usage
